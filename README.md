- 👋 Hi, I’m @AFoggyCloud
- 👀 I’m interested in: Network Pentesting has currently caught my attention.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: SQL. Yeah, a little weird with this going immediately after the last line, but one can learn several things at once, no?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Literally anything. I graduated college recently and need all the experience I can get.
- 📫 How to reach me: I am most easily reached at my email address -> thefoggycloud@gmail.com
- Some of my projects are hosted on repl.it: replit.com/@DominikCloud. They're mostly leftovers from college and one more recent project that Visual Studio refused to compile. It's there if you want to take a look but proceed at your own risk.
